# Bill Of Materials Report and Other Potential Enchancements - LAM Research Project

## Definition of Bill of Materials (BOM)
A Bill of Materials, more popularly known as 'BOM', is a comprehensive list of raw materials, components, assemblies, sub-assemblies, parts, or anything which is required to manufacture the finished product. The finished product or goods may be the final product itself or a semi-finished product which is later consumed to produce a final or a larger product.

## Purpose of BOM
The BOM is a key function of businesses engaged in manufacturing inventories. It helps the manufacturing unit to design, plan inventories, determine cost estimation, etc. It is a centralized source of information used to manufacture a product. It is a list of the items needed to create a product as well as the instructions on how to assemble that product.

## Contents of BOM
The BOM for finished goods not only lists the components but also the quantity of each component required to produce the finished goods. If the finished product has a variant by color, configuration, size, etc., you can choose to have multiple BOMs for a single product. Also, if the production of finished products leads to the production of by-product/co-product or scrap, this can be defined in the BOM.

The format of BOM varies but it contains the essential details as discussed in the above sections. Items included in a BOM are the part number, part name, quantity, unit of measurement, assembly references, method of parts construction, and additional notes.

## Types of BOM
There are different types of BOMs. They include:
- Assembly Bill of Materials
- Configurable BOM
- Single-Level BOM
- Multi-Level BOM
- Engineering Bill of Materials (EBOM)
- Manufacturing Bill of Materials (MBOM)

## Importance of BOM
An accurate, complete BOM helps identify the cause of a product failure and work quickly to replace the faulty parts, materials, and components. BOMs facilitate efficient and accurate manufacturing. By identifying and pricing all the materials and components needed to make a product — before production begins — an organization can determine whether it has everything it needs to move forward with minimal risk of delays.

Continuing from the previous explanation of the Bill of Materials (BOM), let's delve deeper into its application in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.

## Application of BOM in Semiconductor Manufacturing
In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, the BOM plays a crucial role in discrete manufacturing. Discrete manufacturing implies that finished products are made of components or raw materials that can be touched and counted.

For instance, silicon wafers, which make up the largest portion of the materials market and a third of total semiconductor materials sales in 2021, are the most common type of semiconductor wafer and are produced in a range of sizes.

## Case Study: Lean Six Sigma in Semiconductor Manufacturing
A case study titled “Improvement on Bill of Materials Formatting Process by Adopting Lean and Six Sigma Approaches A Case Study in a Semiconductor Industry,” discusses the successful application of Lean and Six Sigma to reducing Bill of Materials processing time and the elimination of waiting and motion wastes.

## Challenges in the Semiconductor Industry
The semiconductor industry faces several challenges, including imbalances between supply and demand, demand for custom specifications, the complexity of global supply chains, the regulation of materials, talent shortages, and the impact of tariffs and consumption tax. These challenges encompassed demand shocks, primarily during the pandemic which necessitated the need for digital devices and services while also disrupting semiconductor production due to pandemic-related constraints.
